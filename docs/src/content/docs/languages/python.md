description: Building Python applications with Railpack
---

Railpack builds and deploys Python applications with support for various package managers and dependency management tools.

## Detection

Your project will be detected as a Python application if any of these conditions are met:

- One of `main.py`, `app.py`, `start.py`, `bot.py`, `hello.py`, or `server.py` exists in the root directory
- A `requirements.txt` file exists
- A `pyproject.toml` file exists
- A `Pipfile` exists

## Versions

Railpack supports Python 3.10 and later. We only officially support Python
versions that are actively maintained by the Python Software Foundation (not
EOL). See [Python release status](https://endoflife.date/python) for current
support status.

The Python version is determined in the following order:

- Set via the `RAILPACK_PYTHON_VERSION` environment variable
- Read from mise-compatible version files (`.python-version`,
  `.tool-versions`, `mise.toml`)
- Read from the `runtime.txt` file
- Read from the `Pipfile` if present
- Defaults to `3.13.2`

## Precompiled vs. Compiled Python

By default, Railpack installs Python using precompiled binaries via Mise.
Precompiled binaries are faster to install and more reliable, but they may not
be available for every Python version (e.g., very new or very old releases).

When a precompiled binary is unavailable, the build will fail. This is
intentional — many popular packages that provide precompiled wheels have not
yet caught up to the latest Python release, meaning pip will fall back to
compiling those packages from source, which frequently fails.

If you need to use a Python version without a precompiled binary and are
prepared to handle any compilation issues that may arise, you can opt into
source compilation. Either set a deploy environment variable:

```sh
MISE_PYTHON_COMPILE=1
```

Or add the following to your `mise.toml`:

```toml title="mise.toml"
[settings.python]
compile = true
```

:::caution
Compiling Python and its packages from source significantly increases build
times and may cause failures for packages that have complex native
dependencies. Only use this if a precompiled binary is unavailable for your
required version.

## Runtime Variables

These variables are available at runtime:

```sh
PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1
PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
PYTHONHASHSEED=random
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=1
PIP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=100
```

## Configuration

Railpack builds your Python application based on your project structure. The build process:

- Installs Python and required system dependencies
- Installs project dependencies using your preferred package manager
- Configures the Python environment for production

The start command is determined by:

1. Framework specific start command (see below)
2. Main Python file in the root directory (checked in order: `main.py`,
   `app.py`, `start.py`, `bot.py`, `hello.py`, `server.py`)

### Package Managers

Railpack supports multiple Python package managers:

- **pip** - Uses `requirements.txt` for dependencies
- **poetry** - Uses `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`
- **pdm** - Uses `pyproject.toml` and `pdm.lock`
- **uv** - Uses `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`
- **pipenv** - Uses `Pipfile`

### Config Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RAILPACK_PYTHON_VERSION` | Override the Python version | `3.11` |
| `RAILPACK_DJANGO_APP_NAME` | Django app name | `myapp.wsgi` |
| `RAILPACK_PYTHON_PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALL` | Install browser binaries | `1` |

### Playwright

When Playwright is a production dependency, Railpack suggests setting
`RAILPACK_PYTHON_PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALL=1`. Railpack does not install browser
binaries automatically because doing so can unexpectedly change existing
builds and increase image size.

When enabled, Railpack installs Playwright's browser binaries and the system
packages needed to run them. Ensure Playwright is included in your production
dependencies so its CLI is available during the build.

### System Dependencies

Railpack installs system dependencies for common Python packages:

- **pycairo**: Installs `libcairo2-dev` (build time) and `libcairo2` (runtime)
- **pdf2image**: Installs `poppler-utils`
- **pydub**: Installs `ffmpeg`
- **pymovie**: Installs `ffmpeg`, `qt5-qmake`, and related Qt packages

## Framework Support

Railpack detects and configures start commands for popular frameworks:

### FastHTML

Railpack detects FastHTML projects when `python-fasthtml` is listed as a
dependency. When detected:

- Starts with `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}` if
  `uvicorn` is a dependency

### Flask

Railpack detects Flask projects when `flask` is listed as a dependency. When
detected:

- Starts with `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:${PORT:-8000} main:app` if `gunicorn`
  is a dependency

### FastAPI

Railpack detects FastAPI projects when `fastapi` is listed as a dependency.
When detected and `uvicorn` is available as a dependency:

- Starts with `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port ${PORT:-8000}`

### Django

Railpack detects Django projects by:

- Presence of `manage.py`
- Django being listed as a dependency

The start command is determined by:

1. `RAILPACK_DJANGO_APP_NAME` environment variable
2. Scanning Python files for `WSGI_APPLICATION` setting
3. Runs `python manage.py migrate && gunicorn {appName}:application`

### Databases

Railpack automatically installs system dependencies for common databases:

- **PostgreSQL**: Installs `libpq-dev` at build time and `libpq5` at runtime
- **MySQL**: Installs `default-libmysqlclient-dev` at build time and `default-mysql-client` at runtime

## BuildKit Caching

The Python provider will cache `/opt/pip-cache` under the cache key `pip`, and, for `uv`-based apps, `/opt/uv-cache` under the key `uv`.
