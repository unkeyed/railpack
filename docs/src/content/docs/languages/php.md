description: Building PHP applications with Railpack
---

Railpack can automatically build and deploy PHP applications with FrankenPHP, a
modern and efficient PHP application server.

## Detection

Your project will be detected as a PHP application if any of these conditions
are met:

- An `index.php` file exists in the root directory
- A `composer.json` file exists in the root directory

## Versions

The PHP version is determined in the following order:

- Read from the `composer.json` file
- Defaults to `8.4`

Only PHP 8.2 and above are supported.

## Configuration

Railpack will configure [FrankenPHP](https://frankenphp.dev/) for your
application. For Laravel applications, the document root is set to the `public`
directory.

### Config Variables

| Variable                   | Description                                         | Example            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `RAILPACK_PHP_ROOT_DIR`    | Override the document root                          | `/app/public`      |
| `RAILPACK_PHP_EXTENSIONS`  | Additional PHP extensions to install                | `gd,imagick,redis` |
| `RAILPACK_SKIP_MIGRATIONS` | Disable running Laravel migrations (default: false) | `true`             |

### Custom Configuration

Railpack uses default
[Caddyfile](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/blob/main/core/providers/php/Caddyfile)
and
[php.ini](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/blob/main/core/providers/php/php.ini)
configuration files. You can override these by placing your own versions in your
project root:

- `/Caddyfile` - Custom Caddy server configuration
- `/php.ini` - Custom PHP configuration

### Startup Process

The application is started using a
[start-container.sh](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/blob/main/core/providers/php/start-container.sh)
script that:

- For Laravel applications:
  - Runs database migrations and seeding (enabled by default, can be disabled with `RAILPACK_SKIP_MIGRATIONS`)
  - Creates storage symlinks
  - Optimizes the application
- Starts the FrankenPHP server using the Caddyfile configuration

You can customize the startup process by placing your own `start-container.sh`
in the project root.

### PHP Extensions

PHP extensions are automatically installed based on:

- Requirements specified in `composer.json` (e.g., `ext-redis`)
- Extensions listed in the `RAILPACK_PHP_EXTENSIONS` environment variable

Example `composer.json` with required extensions:

```json title="composer.json"
{
  "require": {
    "php": ">=8.2",
    "ext-pgsql": "*",
    "ext-redis": "*"
  }
}
```

## Apt Packages

Railpack normally normally installs build and deploy apt packages on different images.
However, PHP uses the FrankenPHP image for both the build and the final image, instead of
the standard railpack runtime base because mise does not support precompiled PHP binaries natively.

[`buildAptPackages`](/guides/installing-packages#apt) and
[`deploy.aptPackages`](/guides/installing-packages#apt) are therefore installed
together on the FrankenPHP image. `...` entries from apt package lists are removed,
and combined list of build and deploy packages are available in the final deploy image.

Packages added for Composer (`git`, `zip`, `unzip`, and `ca-certificates`) stay installed.

For example:

```json title="railpack.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.railpack.com",
  "buildAptPackages": ["libpng-dev"],
  "deploy": {
    "aptPackages": ["jq", "ffmpeg"]
  }
}
```

Will result in `libpng-dev`, `jq`, and `ffmpeg` in the final deploy image.

## Laravel Support

Laravel applications are detected by the presence of an `artisan` file. When
detected:

- The document root is set to the `/app/public` directory
- Storage directory permissions are set to be writable
- Composer dependencies are installed
- Artisan caches are optimized at build time:
  - Configuration cache
  - Event cache
  - Route cache
  - View cache

## Node.js Integration

If a `package.json` file is detected in your PHP project:

- Node.js will be installed
- NPM dependencies will be installed
- Build scripts defined in `package.json` will be executed
- Development dependencies will be pruned in the final image

This is particularly useful for Laravel applications that use frontend
frameworks like Vue.js or React.

You can see the [node docs](/languages/node) for information on how to configure
node.

## BuildKit Caching

The PHP provider will cache `/opt/cache/composer` under the cache key `composer`.
