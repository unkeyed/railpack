## Set the Timezone Explicitly

Railpack does not set a timezone. Set `TZ` explicitly for your application.
`TZ=UTC` is a good default.

```json title="railpack.json"
{
  "deploy": {
    "variables": {
      "TZ": "UTC"
    }
  }
}
```

## Install Python when using `pipx`

If you install `pipx` without also installing Python via mise, pipx will use
the system Python and pip from the Debian runtime image. That Python is old and
can cause compatibility issues with mise and other tooling.

Install Python via mise whenever you use pipx:

```json title="railpack.json"
{
  "packages": {
    "python": "latest",
    "pipx:httpie": "3.2.4"
  }
}
```

Or, even better, configure this in a `mise.toml` instead of a `railpack.json`

## Set the Locale Explicitly

Set `LANG=en_US.UTF-8` so applications and shell tools handle Unicode
correctly. Railpack does not bundle additional locales — only `en_US.UTF-8`
is available in the runtime image. If your application requires a different
locale, install the corresponding locale packages via
[`deploy.aptPackages`](/config/file).

```json title="railpack.json"
{
  "deploy": {
    "variables": {
      "LANG": "en_US.UTF-8"
    }
  }
}
```

## Use Mise for Language and Package Manager Versioning

Although mise supports extracting versions from language-specific configuration
files (`.node-version`, `.python-version`, `runtime.txt`, etc.), mise offers a
much more unified and streamlined way of managing these versions. We highly
recommend moving development configuration as much as you can to mise.

Specify versions of languages, package managers, tools, and other dependencies
in your mise config rather than relying on defaults or `latest`. Pinning
versions keeps local development, CI, and production aligned.

A `mise.toml` in your project keeps tool versions in one place:

```toml title="mise.toml"
[tools]
node = "22.14.0"
python = "3.13.2"
poetry = "2.1.1"
jq = "1.7.1"
```

See [Mise Configuration](/config/mise) for how Railpack detects and applies
mise config during builds.

## Specify the Node and Package Manager Version Explicitly

By default, Railpack will infer the node and package manager version for you.
However, it's much better to explicitly define this in your project, both for your
team and Railpack. This keeps local development, CI, and production builds perfectly aligned.

Package managers supported by mise can be pinned in `mise.toml`:

```toml title="mise.toml"
[tools]
node = "22.14.0"
pnpm = "10.15.1"
```

Mise is the recommended path, but you can use `package.json` configuration as well.

```json title="package.json"
{
  "packageManager": "npm@11.4.2"
}
```

The `devEngines` field can also document the required package manager and
instruct supporting tooling to reject a different version:

```json title="package.json"
{
  "devEngines": {
    "packageManager": {
      "name": "npm",
      "version": "11.4.2",
      "onFail": "error"
    }
  }
}
```

## Prefer Mise Over Apt, pipx, and Other Installers

When you need a CLI tool or utility, prefer installing it with mise over Apt,
pipx, npm, or other package managers. Mise does not support every tool, but it
supports most external tools you are likely to need.

Using mise keeps tool versions consistent with the rest of your config and
avoids coupling your build to distro packages or a separate install path.

```toml title="mise.toml"
[tools]
jq = "1.7.1"
ripgrep = "14.1.1"
```

Reach for Apt when you need system libraries or packages that mise does not
provide (for example `libpq-dev` or `ffmpeg`). See [Installing Additional
Packages](/guides/installing-packages) for how to add mise and Apt packages to
a build.

## Use Mise Lockfiles

Add `locked = true` to your mise config. This ensures that the exact same
version is used for dev, CI, and production.

```toml title="mise.toml"
[tools]
node = "22.14.0"
python = "3.13.2"

[settings]
locked = true
```

Commit the generated lockfile alongside the config (`mise.lock`, or
`mise.local.lock` / `mise.<env>.lock` for those configs). Railpack includes
the lockfile for each detected config.

## Enable GPG Verification

Mise can verify OpenPGP signatures for tools that publish them. Enable
verification for all supported tools in your `mise.toml`:

```toml title="mise.toml"
[settings]
gpg_verify = true

[settings.node]
verify = true
```

Railpack disables Node.js GPG verification by default because newly released
versions may not have a public key available yet. A project-local `mise.toml`
takes precedence over Railpack's generated `/etc/mise/config.toml`, so
`verify = true` reverses that default.

With verification enabled, the build fails when mise cannot verify a tool's
downloaded assets. Pin tool versions to avoid unexpectedly selecting a new
release whose signatures are not yet available.

## Commit Package Manager Lockfiles

Always generate and commit a lockfile from your package manager
(`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`, `Cargo.lock`,
`poetry.lock`, etc.), and keep it in sync with your dependency manifests.

Without a lockfile (or with one that has drifted) installs resolve versions
at build time. That leads to non-deterministic images and therefore possible
bugs that don't occur locally.

## Prefer `npm ci` for npm Node Projects

When using npm as your package manager, set `RAILPACK_NODE_NPM_INSTALL` to
opt into `npm ci` instead of the default `npm install`:

```bash
RAILPACK_NODE_NPM_INSTALL="npm ci"
```

You can also customize the install command in `railpack.json` if you need more
control over the install step:

```json title="railpack.json"
{
  "$schema": "https://schema.railpack.com",
  "steps": {
    "install": {
      // Configuring a step auto-adds it to deploy with include: ["."].
      // Use an empty deployOutputs so install is not copied into the final
      // image; node_modules still reach the image via the build step.
      "deployOutputs": [],
      "commands": [
        // auto-generated commands from railpack
        { "path": "/app/node_modules/.bin" },
        { "src": "package-lock.json", "dest": "package-lock.json" },
        { "src": "package.json", "dest": "package.json" },
        // By default, `npm install` is used here. Use `npm ci` for increased
        // determinism.
        "npm ci"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Railpack defaults to `npm install` because `package.json` and
`package-lock.json` often drift out of sync — usually from npm bugs rather than
intentional local changes. That mismatch rarely shows up in development and only
fails at image build time with:

> `npm ci` can only install packages when your package.json and
> package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json are in sync.

Using `npm install` avoids build failures at the cost of weaker
determinism. You should keep your lockfile in sync and opt into `npm ci` for:

- **Deterministic installs** — exact versions from the lockfile, matching local
  and CI environments, with no silent drift in production
- **Faster installs** — `npm ci` installs from the lockfile instead of resolving
  `package.json` again

## Create a `.dockerignore` File

Create a `.dockerignore` file in your repository root to exclude files and
directories that are not required in production.

Excluding unnecessary files makes your final images smaller, speeds up build
upload times, and eliminates production security risks by minimizing the code
and assets available inside the running container environment:

See [Excluding Files](/config/excluding-files) for full details on pattern
matching and using `railpack.json` exclusions.

## Pick One Ignore Approach

Use a `.dockerignore` file or the `exclude` field in `railpack.json`. Pick one
of those approaches.

When both are present, the two lists are merged into a single pattern list.
`.dockerignore` patterns come first, then `railpack.json` patterns. The last
matching pattern wins, so the lists can negate each other if you aren't
careful. An entry in `railpack.json` can undo a `.dockerignore` rule, and a
`!` pattern in either list can pull a file back into the build.
