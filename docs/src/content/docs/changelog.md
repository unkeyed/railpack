## v0.40.0
September 24, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.40.0)

### Providers

#### Fixed

* **Node:** [Bun projects](https://railpack.com/languages/bun#global-store-bun_install_global_store) now set `BUN_INSTALL_GLOBAL_STORE=0` by default to keep the isolated dependency store local and prevent broken symlinks across container layers. by @iloveitaly in [#756](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/756)
* **PHP:** [Apt package lists](https://railpack.com/languages/php#apt-packages) in FrankenPHP images now properly expand `...` spread operators instead of passing them literally to `apt-get`. by @Tyagiquamar in [#748](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/748)

### CLI

#### Fixed

* **Planner:** File discovery now respects [excluded files](https://railpack.com/config/excluding-files) from `.dockerignore` and `railpack.json`, preventing build failures caused by copying excluded manifests and ignoring excluded local mise configs. by @iloveitaly in [#757](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/757)

### Mise Upgrades

Updated mise from v2026.8.16 to [v2026.9.12](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.9.12).

* **Lockfile revision 2:** Newly generated lockfiles now use revision 2 format with `.mise/locks/` dependency sidecars, and locked installs verify graph integrity. ([v2026.9.7](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.9.7))
* **Go workspace toolchains:** Active `go.work` files with a `toolchain` directive now select the Go version during builds while member `go.mod` files are ignored. ([v2026.9.12](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.9.12))
* **Ruby Gemfile version files:** Bundler `ruby file: ".ruby-version"` declarations in `Gemfile` are now parsed to resolve the project's Ruby version. ([v2026.9.2](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.9.2))
* **Lockfile URL validation:** Installs now fail early if a locked platform URL mismatches the entry's version, preventing silent installation of mismatched releases. ([v2026.9.12](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.9.12))

**Full Changelog**: [v0.39.0...v0.40.0](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/compare/v0.39.0...v0.40.0)

**Full Changelog**: [v0.38.0...v0.39.0](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/compare/v0.38.0...v0.39.0)

## v0.38.0
August 26, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.38.0)

### Breaking Changes

* **pnpm provisioning and devEngines precedence:** pnpm is now installed directly via Mise instead of Corepack, and `devEngines` declarations in `package.json` now take precedence over `engines`, `.nvmrc`, and lockfiles for Node.js and pnpm resolution. ([#678]([#678](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/678)#user-content-breaking-changes))

### Providers

#### New

* **Node:** Railpack now supports [pnpm idiomatic version files](https://railpack.com/languages/node#mise-idiomatic-file-parsing) and `devEngines.packageManager` in `package.json`, provisioning pnpm directly via Mise instead of Corepack. Specify your pnpm version using `"devEngines": { "packageManager": { "name": "pnpm", "version": "9.1.0" } }` (or the array syntax `[{ "name": "pnpm", "version": "9.1.0" }]`), and Railpack will automatically resolve and install it. by @iloveitaly in [#678](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/678)

### Mise Upgrades

Updated mise from v2026.8.11 to [v2026.8.13](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.13).

* **GitHub install rate limits:** Lockfile-pinned tools with checksums no longer query the GitHub API at install time, avoiding rate-limit failures during builds. ([v2026.8.13](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.13))
* **UTF-8 BOM in version files:** Idiomatic version files such as `.tool-versions`, `.node-version`, and `package.json` that begin with a UTF-8 byte-order mark now parse correctly instead of corrupting version strings. ([v2026.8.12](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.12))
* **Monorepo lockfiles:** Tool versions across monorepo directories are now tracked in their respective lockfiles rather than merged into a single file. ([v2026.8.13](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.13))
* **Go GOROOT isolation:** `go install` no longer inherits a `GOROOT` exported for a different Go installation, preventing tool version mismatch errors. ([v2026.8.12](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.12))

**Full Changelog**: [v0.37.1...v0.38.0](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/compare/v0.37.1...v0.38.0)

## v0.37.1
August 24, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.37.1)

### Breaking Changes

* **Cache disabling:** `RAILPACK_DISABLE_CACHES` is no longer read from the host process environment and must be passed explicitly via `--env`. ([#696]([#696](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/696)#user-content-breaking-changes))

### CLI

#### Fixed

* **Cache disabling:** `RAILPACK_DISABLE_CACHES` is now configured via `--env` and applied during build plan generation, ensuring cache mounts are deterministically stripped matching other [build environment variables](https://railpack.com/config/environment-variables). by @iloveitaly in [#696](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/696)
* **Image environment:** Deduplicate inherited `PATH` entries when merging build and deploy environments, preventing duplicate paths in the final image while preserving precedence. by @iloveitaly in [#697](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/697)

### Mise Upgrades

Updated mise from v2026.8.6 to [v2026.8.11](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.11).

* **Ruby on musl:** glibc precompiled Ruby binaries are now skipped on musl Linux environments, falling back to ruby-build. ([v2026.8.11](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.11))
* **npm version resolution:** Deprecated versions are now filtered out during tool version resolution. ([v2026.8.11](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.11))
* **Aqua Linux assets:** glibc Linux targets now prefer glibc release assets over musl binaries when resolving tools. ([v2026.8.9](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.9))
* **Erlang checksums:** Precompiled Erlang installations now verify checksums. ([v2026.8.7](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.7))

**Full Changelog**: [v0.37.0...v0.37.1](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/compare/v0.37.0...v0.37.1)

## v0.37.0
August 18, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.37.0)

### Breaking Changes

* **Debian 13 base images:** New builds now use Debian 13 (Trixie), requiring custom Apt package lists and pinned base images to be compatible with Debian 13. ([#698]([#698](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/698)#user-content-breaking-changes))
* **GCC 14 native builds:** Native gem and extension compilation now uses GCC 14, treating incompatible pointer types as errors and potentially requiring dependency updates or compiler flags. ([#705]([#705](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/705)#user-content-breaking-changes))

### CLI

#### New

* **Debian 13:** Builder and runtime base images are now upgraded to Debian 13 (Trixie). Configure [custom Apt packages](https://railpack.com/guides/installing-packages#apt) with Debian 13 package names using `RAILPACK_DEPLOY_APT_PACKAGES` or `deploy.aptPackages`. by @iloveitaly in [#698](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/698)

#### Fixed

* **Debian 13:** Builder images now include `libicu-dev` to ensure .NET restore and native gem compilation succeed on Debian 13, and Railpack warns during build planning when custom Apt packages are detected. by @iloveitaly in [#705](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/705)

### Mise Upgrades

Updated mise from v2026.8.4 to [v2026.8.6](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.6).

* **Resumable downloads:** Interrupted artifact downloads now resume via HTTP Range requests, and transient network errors such as HTTP/2 stream refusals are automatically retried. ([v2026.8.6](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.6))
* **Precompiled PyPy:** PyPy can now be installed via precompiled binaries when compilation is disabled. ([v2026.8.5](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.5))
* **Node source patching:** Node source builds can now apply local or remote patches before configuration using `node.apply_patches`. ([v2026.8.5](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.5))
* **Rust nightly toolchains:** The rolling `nightly` channel resolves to concrete date-based toolchains for reproducible lockfiles and caching. ([v2026.8.6](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.6))

**Full Changelog**: [v0.36.4...v0.37.0](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/compare/v0.36.4...v0.37.0)

**Full Changelog**: [v0.36.0...v0.36.1](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/compare/v0.36.0...v0.36.1)

## v0.36.0
August 10, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.36.0)

### Providers

#### New

* **Node:** [TanStack Start](https://railpack.com/languages/node/#framework-support) apps are detected via `@tanstack/react-start` and are no longer treated as static Vite SPAs. If no `start` script is defined, Railpack installs `srvx` and starts with `srvx --prod -s ../client dist/server/server.js`; for production Node deploys, configure Nitro per TanStack's hosting guidance. by @iloveitaly in [#672](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/672)
* **Node:** the default Node version is now `lts` instead of a fixed major, and non-semver aliases such as `lts` resolve correctly through mise. Pin a version with `RAILPACK_NODE_VERSION`, `engines.node`, or a version file as described in the [Node versions](https://railpack.com/languages/node/#versions) docs. by @iloveitaly in [#650](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/650)
* **Node:** projects with a `package-lock.json` are detected as npm when no other package manager is configured. Prefer pinning Node and package manager versions for reproducible builds; see the [dependency recommendations](https://railpack.com/architecture/recommendations). by @iloveitaly in [#677](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/677)
* **Rust:** [rust-toolchain.toml](https://railpack.com/languages/rust/#versions) is honored as an idiomatic version file (including channel, profile, components, and targets). Add a root `rust-toolchain.toml` such as `channel = "1.85.0"` and Railpack will install that toolchain via mise. by @iloveitaly in [#676](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/676)
* **.NET:** [global.json](https://railpack.com/languages/dotnet/#versions) is honored as an idiomatic version file so `sdk.version` selects the .NET SDK. Add a root `global.json` such as `{ "sdk": { "version": "8.0.100" } }` to pin the SDK. by @iloveitaly in [#675](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/675)

### CLI

#### New

* **Build context:** `.dockerignore` patterns (and top-level `exclude` in `railpack.json`) are applied when the local source is first loaded into BuildKit, so large ignored directories like `node_modules` are no longer transferred during local builds. Configure exclusions in `.dockerignore` or via top-level `exclude` in [railpack.json](https://railpack.com/config/excluding-files). by @iloveitaly in [#373](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/373)

#### Fixed

* **Config:** explicit `deploy.inputs` with include filters are no longer overridden by an implicit full-step deploy output, preserving selections such as Next.js standalone output. by @radiantjade in [#562](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/562)
* **Secrets:** CLI `--env` secrets are preserved when a config file also defines secrets, instead of being dropped. by @cadeljones in [#460](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/460)

### Mise Upgrades

Updated mise from v2026.7.15 to [v2026.8.3](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.3).

* **Precompiled Ruby:** when `ruby.compile` is unset, mise installs precompiled Ruby binaries by default and falls back to source builds only when no binary is available. ([v2026.8.0](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.0))
* **Release-age filters:** `minimum_release_age` and related filters use GitHub's `published_at` timestamp so newly published releases of older commits no longer bypass age gates across Aqua, GitHub, Ubi, and related backends. ([v2026.8.3](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.8.3))
* **npm lockfile installs:** packages pinned in `mise.lock` are trusted through the low-download popularity gate, so locked npm tool installs no longer require `allow_low_downloads`. ([v2026.7.16](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.7.16))
* **Idiomatic version files:** disable individual idiomatic files per tool with `idiomatic_version_file_disable_files` (for example `node:package.json`) while keeping others active. ([v2026.7.17](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.7.17))

July 28, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.35.0)

### Providers

#### New

* **Node & Python:** Playwright browser installation is now opt-in, preventing unexpected image-size increases. Set `RAILPACK_NODE_PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALL=1` or `RAILPACK_PYTHON_PLAYWRIGHT_INSTALL=1` when Playwright is a production dependency; see the [Node](https://railpack.com/languages/node/#playwright) and [Python](https://railpack.com/languages/python/#playwright) documentation. by @iloveitaly in [#653](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/653)

### CLI

#### New

## v0.34.0
July 27, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.34.0)

### Providers

#### New

* **Node.js:** npm projects now use `npm install` by default, preventing builds from failing when `package-lock.json` is missing or out of sync. Set `RAILPACK_NODE_NPM_INSTALL="npm ci"` to opt into deterministic installs; Railpack also suggests committing missing npm and pnpm lockfiles, as described in the [dependency recommendations](https://railpack.com/architecture/recommendations). by @iloveitaly in [#643](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/643)

### CLI

#### New

July 23, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.33.0)

### Providers

#### New

* **SvelteKit:** Projects using `@sveltejs/adapter-auto` now automatically produce and run a Node server without manual adapter configuration. Keep `@sveltejs/adapter-auto` in your dependencies, and Railpack will select `adapter-node` during the build and start it with `node build`. by @iloveitaly in [#641](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/641)

#### Fixed

* **React Router:** [React Router SPA projects](https://railpack.com/languages/node#static-sites) with `ssr: false` are now correctly detected and served as static sites, even when the default `react-router-serve ./build/server/index.js` start script is present. by @iloveitaly in [#604](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/604)

### CLI

#### New

* **Apt Packages:** Custom Apt package lists can now use the `...` spread operator to retain packages generated by Railpack. Follow the [package installation guide](https://railpack.com/guides/installing-packages#apt) and configure `"buildAptPackages": ["...", "build-essential"]` or `"deploy": { "aptPackages": ["...", "ffmpeg"] }`; omit `...` when you intentionally want to replace the generated list. by @iloveitaly in [#645](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/645)

#### Fixed

* **Mise:** Railpack now uses musl-compatible mise binaries on Linux, fixing execution on Alpine and other musl-based hosts. by @iloveitaly in [#642](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/642)

**Full Changelog**: [v0.32.0...v0.33.0](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/compare/v0.32.0...v0.33.0)

## v0.32.0
July 22, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.32.0)

### Providers

#### New

* **Node:** Railpack now supports [Next.js applications in Nx workspaces](https://railpack.com/languages/node#nx), including projects that use inferred tasks instead of root build and start scripts. Single-app workspaces are selected automatically; for multi-app workspaces, select an app with `RAILPACK_NX_APP=web railpack build .`. by @iloveitaly in [#606](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/606)

#### Fixed

* **Node:** Railpack now displays a build-plan warning when no package manager is detected and npm is selected by default. by @iloveitaly in [#638](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/638)

### CLI

#### New

* **Mise:** Updated mise version from v2026.7.7 to [v2026.7.11](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.7.11).
* **Build Cache:** The [build command](https://railpack.com/reference/cli#build) now supports `--no-cache` for rebuilding without cached layers while preserving package-manager cache mounts. Run `railpack build --no-cache .` to perform a fresh build. by @iloveitaly in [#516](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/516)
* **Build Output:** Build progress and completion output is now easier to scan, with a distinct start header and a formatted summary containing the build duration and next command. by @iloveitaly in [#640](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/640)
* **Runtime Images:** Runtime images now expose [`RAILPACK_VERSION`](https://railpack.com/architecture/secrets#environment-variables), allowing applications and diagnostics to identify the Railpack version that produced the image. Access it through the `RAILPACK_VERSION` environment variable inside the running container. by @iloveitaly in [#633](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/633)

* **Build:** The [`build` command](https://railpack.com/reference/cli/#build) now supports BuildKit [cache import and export](https://railpack.com/architecture/caching/#cache-backends) via `--cache-from` and `--cache-to`, using the same syntax as docker buildx. For example: `railpack build --cache-from type=registry,ref=my.registry/cache --cache-to type=registry,ref=my.registry/cache,mode=max .` by @mvanhorn in [#595](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/595)
* **Build:** `railpack build` now uses credentials from your Docker CLI config (`$DOCKER_CONFIG`, default `~/.docker/config.json`) so BuildKit can pull from and push to private registries. Log in with `docker login` first if needed. by @iloveitaly in [#623](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/623)

#### New

* **Deno:** Railpack now reads Deno versions from `.deno-version` files using mise idiomatic version file support. Add a `.deno-version` file to your project root (for example, `2.2.2`) to pin the Deno runtime for your deployment — see [version detection](https://railpack.com/languages/deno#versions) for the full precedence order. by @iloveitaly in [#608](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/608)

#### Fixed

* **Python, Ruby, Deno:** `RAILPACK_PYTHON_VERSION`, `RAILPACK_RUBY_VERSION`, and `RAILPACK_DENO_VERSION` environment variables now correctly override local version files and mise configuration during builds, matching the documented precedence order. Set these in your deployment environment when you need to pin a runtime version independently of repository config. by @Vunas in [#610](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/610)

June 18, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.29.0)

### Providers

#### New

* **Node:** Railpack now detects and deploys Next.js apps configured for static export as SPAs, serving the built site with Caddy. Set `output: 'export'` in your `next.config.ts` (or `.js`/`.mjs`) and Railpack will build and serve the static output from `out` (or your configured `distDir`). See the [Node.js SPA documentation](https://railpack.com/languages/node#spa-mode) for details. by @iloveitaly in [#602](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/602)

* **Node:** Node SPA deployments now honor the `index_fallback` key in a `Staticfile` at your project root. SPA routing is unchanged by default, but you can set `index_fallback: false` to disable `index.html` fallback on unknown routes—useful for multi-page static sites that need custom 404 pages. See the [Node.js SPA documentation](https://railpack.com/languages/node#spa-mode) for details. by @iloveitaly in [#582](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/582)

* **Node:** Bun-only apps with no dependencies no longer install Node.js in the final image when it isn't needed. by @iloveitaly in [#601](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/601)

#### Fixed

* **Node:** Expo projects using the default `expo start` command are no longer incorrectly treated as having a custom start command, so SPA detection works as expected. by @iloveitaly in [#582](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/582)

* **Node:** `RAILPACK_NODE_VERSION` now correctly takes precedence over `engines.node` in `package.json`, matching the documented version resolution order. by @iloveitaly in [#601](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/601)

**Full Changelog**: [v0.28.0...v0.29.0](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/compare/v0.28.0...v0.29.0)

June 17, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.28.0)

### Providers

#### New

* **Expo Web:** Railpack now detects [Expo Web](https://railpack.com/languages/node/) projects configured for static export as SPAs and serves the built output from `dist` with the static file server. Configure `expo.web.output` to `static` or `single` in `app.json`, ensure `expo` and `react-native-web` are in your dependencies, and add a `build` script such as `expo export --platform web` to your `package.json`. by @iloveitaly in [#585](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/585)

#### Fixed

* **Node:** Increased the default npm fetch retry count to 5 (`NPM_CONFIG_FETCH_RETRIES=5`) to improve build reliability against transient registry network errors during dependency installation. by @iloveitaly in [#598](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/598)

### CLI

#### New

* **Mise:** Updated mise version from v2026.6.0 to [v2026.6.1](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.6.1).

### Runtime

* **Locale:** Builder and runtime images now include the `en_US.UTF-8` locale, fixing warnings and breakage for apps that depend on locale-aware behavior (such as Python or Ruby). Railpack does not set `LANG` or `LC_ALL` by default — enable UTF-8 by adding them to [`deploy.variables`](https://railpack.com/config/file) in your `railpack.json` (for example, `"LANG": "en_US.UTF-8"`). by @iloveitaly in [#576](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/576)
* **Timezone:** Builder and runtime images now include `tzdata` by default, so named timezones work out of the box when you set `TZ` or use libraries that read the zoneinfo database. by @iloveitaly in [#580](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/580)

**Full Changelog**: [v0.26.1...v0.27.0](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/compare/v0.26.1...v0.27.0)

## v0.26.1

### Providers

#### Fixed

* **Node:** pnpm 11+ projects now build correctly by adding `PNPM_HOME/bin` to the `PATH` so the pre-install `node-gyp` step can be found, including when `engines.pnpm` uses x-range notation like `"11.5.x"`. by @iloveitaly in [#581](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/581)

## v0.26.0
June 2, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.26.0)

### Providers

#### Fixed

* **Node (pnpm):** Railpack now sets `PNPM_HOME` to `/opt/pnpm` and `PNPM_STORE_DIR` to `/opt/pnpm/store` during every pnpm install so BuildKit caches the store path pnpm actually uses. This fixes missed install cache hits when newer pnpm versions write outside the old hardcoded store location. by @iloveitaly in [#569](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/569)

### CLI

#### Fixed

* **Config:** Custom runtime images set via [`deploy.base`](https://railpack.com/config/file) in `railpack.json` are now applied to the generated deploy step. Previously Railpack parsed `deploy.base` but did not use it when building the final image; configured bases are used as the deploy filesystem and as the input for runtime apt package layers when those are enabled. by @radiantjade in [#561](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/561)

* **Mise:** Builds no longer fail when `mise.lock` pins a tool version newer than the default [14-day minimum release age](https://railpack.com/config/mise) while your config requests `latest`. Host-side version resolution applies the age filter first, then falls back when a pinned lockfile version would otherwise be excluded. by @iloveitaly in [#575](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/575)

## v0.25.0
June 1, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.25.0)

### Providers

#### New

* **Node:** Railpack now detects and builds projects that use `package.json5` manifests (in addition to `package.json`), including workspace and dependency parsing. If both files exist, `package.json` takes precedence. by @iloveitaly in [#566](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/566)

* **Node:** Node 25+ apps that use Corepack (for example `packageManager: "pnpm@..."`) now include the mise install and shim directories in the runtime image, so package managers like `pnpm` remain available when your start command runs after the build. by @iloveitaly in [#568](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/568)

#### Fixed

* **Node:** `engines.pnpm` in your manifest now takes precedence over pnpm version inferred from `pnpm-lock.yaml`, avoiding ambiguous lockfile version mapping across major pnpm releases. See [package and version resolution](https://railpack.com/architecture/package-resolution/) for how Railpack resolves tool versions. by @iloveitaly in [#566](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/566)

### CLI

#### New

* **Config:** The `provider` field in `railpack.json` is now listed in the generated JSON schema (`railpack schema`), with the same values documented in the [config file guide](https://railpack.com/config/file/). Provider names are matched case-insensitively, so lowercase values like `elixir` and `dotnet` work as documented. by @radiantjade in [#558](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/558)

* **Mise:** Updated mise version from v2026.5.16 to [v2026.5.18](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.5.18).

**Full Changelog**: [v0.24.0...v0.25.0](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/compare/v0.24.0...v0.25.0)

## v0.24.0
May 29, 2026 · [GitHub release](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/releases/tag/v0.24.0)

### Providers

#### New

* **Node:** Package manager versions for pnpm, bun, and yarn defined in mise config (`mise.toml`, `.tool-versions`, etc.) now take priority over versions inferred from lockfiles or project metadata. Pin a version in your config—for example `pnpm = "10.4.1"` in `mise.toml`—and Railpack will use it consistently across the build. See [Node.js versions](https://railpack.com/languages/node#versions) and [Mise configuration](https://railpack.com/config/mise). by @iloveitaly in [#564](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/564)

#### Fixed

* **Node:** Builds using pnpm 11+ now add `PNPM_HOME/bin` to `PATH`, matching pnpm’s new layout so global tools like `node-gyp` install and run correctly. by @iloveitaly in [#564](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/564)

* **Ruby:** Ruby source builds no longer install rdoc, avoiding locale-related compile failures during `mise install`. by @iloveitaly in [#564](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/564)

* **Elixir:** Elixir provider environment variables (locale, `MIX_ENV`, `MIX_HOME`, etc.) are now applied to the mise install step so Erlang and Elixir install with the same settings as the rest of the build. by @iloveitaly in [#564](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/564)

* **Python:** Projects using Poetry, PDM, or Pipenv via pipx now also install `uv`, which newer mise requires when `pipx.uvx` is enabled. by @iloveitaly in [#564](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/564)

### CLI

#### New

* **Mise:** Updated mise version from v2026.3.17 to [v2026.5.16](https://github.com/jdx/mise/releases/tag/v2026.5.16).

#### Fixed

* **Mise:** Generated `/etc/mise/config.toml` now sets `minimum_release_age` instead of the renamed `install_before` setting, matching current mise behavior. Override it in your own [mise configuration](https://railpack.com/config/mise) if needed. by @iloveitaly in [#564](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/564)

* **Mise:** Introduced a [new installation policy](https://railpack.com/config/mise) that defaults to tool versions released at least 14 days ago to avoid broken or incomplete tool versions. by @iloveitaly in [#540](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/540)
  This setting improves stability for runtime environments like Python and Ruby by allowing upstream releases time to stabilize before they are used in production builds.
* **Verbose Mode:** Added support for the `RAILPACK_VERBOSE` environment variable to enable [verbose logging](https://railpack.com/config/environment-variables) and improved debug logs for mise execution. by @iloveitaly in [#536](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/536)
  Set `RAILPACK_VERBOSE=1` to enable detailed debug output, including the full command string and captured output from mise during execution.

* **Configuration:** Railpack now uses a global `mise.toml` to store default tool configurations instead of environment variables, allowing users to naturally override defaults via their project's local `mise.toml` file. This change makes it easier to customize tool versions and settings without needing to manage complex environment variables. For example, you can now add a `[settings]` section to your project's `mise.toml` to specify exact settings that Railpack should use. by @iloveitaly in [#504](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/504)

* **Node:** For Bun projects that require Node.js for build tooling (like `node-gyp`), Railpack now installs Node.js using `mise`, respecting versions from `.nvmrc`, `.node-version`, and other `mise` configurations. by @iloveitaly in [#341](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/341)
* **Gleam:** You can now include your project's source code in the final image by setting the `RAILPACK_GLEAM_INCLUDE_SOURCE=true` environment variable. by @iloveitaly in [#318](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/318)

To disable all caches, set it to `*`. by @aleksrutins in [#316](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/316)

#### Fixed

* **Security:** Railpack now enables `mise`'s "paranoid mode" by default, a security feature that requires explicit user consent before installing new tools or running code from project-specific configurations. by @iloveitaly in [#336](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/pull/336)

  For example, to use Node.js v20 and pnpm v9, you can add the following to your `package.json`:
  ```json
  {
    "engines": {
      "node": "20.x",
      "pnpm": "9.x"
    }
