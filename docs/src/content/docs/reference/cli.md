## Commands

### build

Builds a container image from a project directory using BuildKit.

**Usage:**

```bash
railpack build [options] DIRECTORY
```

**Options:**

| Flag           | Description                                                                 | Default |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `--name`       | Name of the image to build                                                  |         |
| `--output`     | Output the final filesystem to a local directory                            |         |
| `--platform`   | Platform to build for (e.g. linux/amd64, linux/arm64)                       |         |
| `--progress`   | BuildKit progress output mode (auto, plain, tty)                            | `auto`  |
| `--show-plan`  | Show the build plan before building                                         | `false` |
| `--cache-key`  | Unique id to prefix to cache keys                                           |         |
| `--cache-from` | External cache sources (same as docker buildx). e.g. type=registry,ref=...  |         |
| `--cache-to`   | Cache export destinations (same as docker buildx). e.g. type=registry,ref=... |       |
| `--no-cache`   | Do not use cache when building (boolean flag)                               | `false` |

`railpack build` uses credentials from your Docker CLI config
(`$DOCKER_CONFIG`, default `~/.docker/config.json`) so BuildKit can pull or
push private registry images. Log in with `docker login` first if needed.

### prepare

Generates build configuration files without performing the actual build. This is
useful for platforms that want to:

- Build with a custom frontend and need to save the build plan to a
  `railpack-plan.json` file
- Log the Railpack pretty output to stdout
- Save the additional build information for later use

**Usage:**

```bash
railpack prepare [options] DIRECTORY
```

**Options:**

| Flag         | Description                                           |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `--plan-out` | Output file for the JSON serialized build plan        |
| `--info-out` | Output file for the JSON serialized build result info |

### plan

Analyzes a directory and outputs the build plan that would be used.

**Usage:**

```bash
railpack plan [options] DIRECTORY
```

**Options:**

| Flag          | Description                   |
| ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `--out`, `-o` | Output file name for the plan |

### info

Provides detailed information about a project's detected configuration,
dependencies, and build requirements.

**Usage:**

```bash
railpack info [options] DIRECTORY
```

**Options:**

| Flag       | Description                  | Default  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | -------- |
| `--format` | Output format (pretty, json) | `pretty` |
| `--out`    | Output file name             |          |

### schema

Outputs the JSON schema for Railpack configuration files, used by IDEs for
autocompletion and validation.

**Usage:**

```bash
railpack schema
```

### completion

Generates shell completion scripts for your preferred shell.

**Usage:**

```bash
railpack completion [bash|zsh|fish|pwsh]
```

#### Setup

The most reliable way to enable completion is to source it directly in your shell configuration file.

**Zsh**
Add this to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash title="~/.zshrc"
source <(railpack completion zsh)
```

**Bash**
Add this to your `~/.bashrc`:

```bash title="~/.bashrc"
source <(railpack completion bash)
```

**Fish**
Add this to your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish title="~/.config/fish/config.fish"
railpack completion fish | source
```

#### Advanced: Zsh Plugin Managers

If you use a plugin manager like **Zinit**, you can load the completion without cloning the entire repository by using a snippet to point directly to the plugin file:

```zsh
zinit ice wait'0'
zinit snippet https://raw.githubusercontent.com/railwayapp/railpack/main/railpack.plugin.zsh
```

### frontend

Starts the BuildKit GRPC frontend server for internal build system use.

**Usage:**

```bash
railpack frontend
```

## Global Options

These options can be used with any command:

| Flag              | Description              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| `--help`, `-h`    | Show help information    |
| `--version`, `-v` | Show version information |
| `--verbose`       | Enable verbose logging   |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning                                                                       |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | Success                                                                       |
| `1`  | The command failed for a reason that will not change on a retry               |
| `75` | The command failed for a transient reason and is worth retrying (EX_TEMPFAIL) |

Exit code `75` is only used for failures that say nothing about the app being
built, such as a network error while downloading Mise. Everything else — no
provider detected, a missing start command, an invalid config file — exits
with `1` and will fail the same way on every attempt.

Platforms that run Railpack in a build pipeline should retry on `75` and fail
the build on `1`. If the process exits without a code at all (the driver never
ran), that is also worth retrying.
