title: Developing Locally
description: Learn how to develop Railpack locally
---

We love contributions to Railpack! This guide is to help Railpack developers understand the system quickly.

Some pre-requisites:

* [Check out the repo](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack)
* [Install Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/installing-mise.html)

## Getting Setup

[Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) is used to manage language dependencies and
tasks for building and testing Railpack. Checkout `mise.toml` in the root
repo for more information on various lifecycle tasks.

Install and use all versions of tools needed for Railpack:

```bash
# optional: load dev tools from mise.dev.toml
echo 'env = ["dev"]' > .miserc.toml
mise install
mise run setup
```

This command starts a BuildKit container (check out `mise.toml` in the root
directory for more information).

### Remote Docker host

Integration tests and local builds store images and BuildKit cache on
the Docker host. Point Docker at another machine to keep tens of
gigabytes of that data off your laptop if you are actively working on Railpack.

Set this in a `mise.local.toml`:

```toml title="mise.local.toml"
[env]
DOCKER_HOST = "ssh://user@host"
```

Leave `BUILDKIT_HOST` unset unless the remote container is not named
`buildkit`. Use key/agent SSH auth. The remote host needs a running
privileged `buildkit` container.

Confirm the engine with `docker info` (`Name` is the hostname):

```bash
docker info -f '{{.Name}} {{.OperatingSystem}}'
docker context inspect -f '{{.Endpoints.docker.Host}}'
```

If you use a remote Docker host with a different CPU architecture, specify
the target platform explicitly. Without `--platform`, the CLI selects the
architecture of the machine running Railpack, not the remote Docker host;
`DOCKER_HOST` only changes where the build executes. Use a flag such as
`--platform linux/amd64` for CLI builds, or set `"platform": "linux/amd64"`
in an example's `test.json`, matching a platform supported by the remote
BuildKit worker.

Use the `cli` task to run the Railpack CLI (this is like `railpack --help`)

```bash
mise run cli --help
```

If you want to compile a development build of Railpack to use elsewhere on your machine:

```bash
mise run build

# add the Railpack repo `bin/` directory to your path to use the newly-compiled Railpack on your machine
export PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH"
```

## Lifecyle of a Change

Most improvements to Railpack look like:

1. There's a motivating problem: a new javascript framework that doesn't work without tinkering, a new language feature we want to support, etc.
2. Reproduce the failure in a new `example/` project and make sure it fails with `mise run test-integration-cwd`.
3. Point AI at the failing project and work out a solution.
4. Deslop edits, tests, etc.
5. Make sure documentation is updated.
6. Update snapshots with `mise run test-update-snapshots` and manually review changes to make sure there were weren't any unintended side effects.
7. Run `mise run test` and `mise run check` to make sure unit tests and all linters are clean.
8. Submit a PR using this [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

Pro-tip: point your agent at this guide.

## Building directly with BuildKit

**👋 Requirement**: an instance of BuildKit must be reachable from the
Docker CLI. Run `mise run setup` to start a local BuildKit container, or
point Docker at a remote host (see [Remote Docker host](#remote-docker-host)).

Railpack will instantiate a BuildKit client and communicate over GRPC in
order to build the generated LLB.

```bash
mise run cli --verbose build examples/node-bun
```

Remember, `mise run` runs the cli in the root project directory. So, if you are in a specific project example directory, you'll want to specify the path to the example directory as an absolute path:

```bash
cd examples/node-angular/
mise run cli build $(pwd)
```

## Docker Images

Multiple Docker images are used in Railpack:

* **`images/alpine/frontend/`** for the Railpack BuildKit frontend. These are simple: they include a railpack binary in a image that can be executed by the buildpack frontend. One is designed to be built for production, one is for local testing and development. These are not used by the user's application during build or runtime.
* **`images/debian/*`:** for the Railpack build process. These are used within the buildpack exection of the railpack-generated llb.
  * `images/debian/build` used during the llb build process. These contain common tools, languages, mise, etc that might be used during the build process. Note that all of these utilities are *not* included in the final image in order to reduce the total image size.
  * `images/debian/runtime` a bare bones debian image used at runtime. The tools, build artifacts, etc generated during the railpack build are added to this base image.

Build the runtime image for local development with:

```bash
mise run image-runtime-build
```

## Custom frontend

You can build with the [BuildKit frontend](/platforms/buildkit-frontend), but
this is a bit tedious for local iteration.

The frontend needs to be built into an image and accessible to the BuildKit instance:

```bash
docker build \
  -f images/alpine/frontend/Dockerfile \
  -t railpack-frontend:local \
  .
```

Then, generate a build plan for an app:

```bash
mise run cli plan examples/node-bun --out test/railpack-plan.json
```

With the image you built previously, you can now run the build:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --build-arg BUILDKIT_SYNTAX="railpack-frontend:local" \
  -f test/railpack-plan.json \
  examples/node-bun
```

You can also use the `buildctl` command to run BuildKit directly. This is helpful as it's a lower level command which
exposes helpful debugging flags. However, you can't reference the locally built image without loading it into a registry first.

Start the registry, then build and push the frontend image with
`image-frontend-build`:

```bash
mise run image-run-registry
mise run image-frontend-build
```

Then, you can run the build with the locally-build frontend:

```bash
buildctl build \
  --frontend=gateway.v0 \
  --opt source=host.docker.internal:7890/railpack-frontend:local \
  --local context=examples/node-bun \
  --local dockerfile=test \
  --output type=docker,name=test | docker load
```

The `dockerfile=` param instructs railpack to use that directory to look for the `railpack-plan.json` file. The `context=` param is the path to the app to build. More specifically, `--local` 'uploads' the referenced directories
to the buildkit daemon.

Note the `docker load` here to load the image into Docker. However, you can
change the [output](https://github.com/moby/buildkit?tab=readme-ov-file#output)
or push to a registry instead.

You can also provide additional configuration to buildctl, like registry
cache import/export (use top-level flags, not `--opt`):

```bash
buildctl build \
  --frontend=gateway.v0 \
  --opt source=host.docker.internal:7890/railpack-frontend:local \
  --local context=examples/node-bun \
  --local dockerfile=test \
  --export-cache type=registry,ref=host.docker.internal:7890/node-bun:cache,mode=max \
  --import-cache type=registry,ref=host.docker.internal:7890/node-bun:cache
```

Note that the cache arguments are different than what `docker buildx`. The equivalent `docker buildx` command would be:


```bash
docker buildx build \
  --build-arg BUILDKIT_SYNTAX="host.docker.internal:7890/railpack-frontend:local" \
  --cache-to=type=registry,ref=host.docker.internal:7890/node-bun:cache,mode=max \
  --cache-from=type=registry,ref=host.docker.internal:7890/node-bun:cache \
  -f test/railpack-plan.json \
  examples/node-bun
```

Debugging a buildkit related problem? Enable debug logging:

```bash
buildctl --debug build \
  --frontend=gateway.v0 \
  --opt source=host.docker.internal:7890/railpack-frontend:local \
  --local context=examples/node-bun \
  --local dockerfile=test \
  --progress=plain \
  --trace=tmp/buildctl-build-trace.log \
  --debug-json-cache-metrics stdout
```

Quick note about `buildctl` vs `docker buildx`. These two ways of invoking the railpack frontend handle arguments differently:

* `--build-arg` prefixes the argument with `build-arg:`.
* `--opt` does not prefix the build arg at all. You must prefix args with `build-arg:` if they are
  arguments handled by the railpack frontend.

## Unit Tests

Railpack uses [go-snaps](https://github.com/gkampitakis/go-snaps) for snapshot
testing. This helps prevent regressions to generated build plans. All example plans are snapshot tested in `core_test.go`

If you see a test failure because of a snapshot change, please confirm that the
change is intentional, and then update the snapshot by running:

```bash
mise run test-update-snapshots
```

## Integration Tests

Integration tests build and run example applications (in `examples/`) in containers to verify end-to-end functionality. Each example with a `test.json` file gets tested
automatically.

```bash
# Run all integration tests, this takes a long time. Let CI do this for you.
mise run test-integration

# Run specific test
mise run test-integration -- -run "TestExamplesIntegration/python-uv-tool-versions"

# Or, from within an examples/ directory, run the test for that example
cd examples/python-uv-tool-versions
mise run test-integration-cwd
```

The `test.json` file contains an array of test cases. Each case builds and runs the same
image but checks for different expected output strings. See [this
file](https://github.com/railwayapp/railpack/blob/main/integration_tests/run_test.go#L26)
for the schema.

### HTTP Checks

In addition to an output assertion, you can run an HTTP check that starts the
container and asserts that a specific route returns an expected HTTP code:

```json title="test.json"
{
  "httpCheck": {
    "path": "/",
    "expected": 200,
    "internalPort": 3000
  }
}
```

### Output Assertions

You can verify that the application outputs specific strings. `expectedOutput` can
be a single string or an array of strings that all must be present in the output:

```json title="test.json"
{
  "expectedOutput": "Server running on port 3000"
}
```

Or with multiple strings:

```json title="test.json"
{
  "expectedOutput": [
    "Elixir version: 1.18",
    "Erlang/OTP version: 27"
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

You can pass environment variables to the container at runtime using the
`envs` key. This is useful for testing with different configurations, secrets,
or Railpack configuration variables:

```json title="test.json"
{
  "expectedOutput": "Server running on port 3000",
  "envs": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "postgresql://user:password@postgres:5432/db",
    "SECRET_KEY": "test-secret"
  }
}
```

You can also use `RAILPACK_*` configuration variables in `envs` to test
different build configurations:

```json title="test.json"
{
  "expectedOutput": "hello from Node",
  "envs": {
    "RAILPACK_PRUNE_DEPS": "true",
    "RAILPACK_STATIC_FILE_ROOT": "/custom/path"
  }
}
```

See the [environment variables
documentation](/config/environment-variables) for a complete list of available
`RAILPACK_*` configuration options.

### Services

Integration tests can define services (postgres, redis, anything with a docker image) that
are required for the application to run. Create a `docker-compose.yml` in a test directory
and it will automatically be picked up and run before the project container is run.

Here's an example of how to run the container locally to manually test it:

```shell
docker compose up -d
docker run -it --network python-django_default --env DATABASE_URL="postgresql://django_user:django_password@postgres:5432/django_db" python-django
```

## Mise

Mise is critical to this project. For any serious change, you'll need to understand how mise works in detail.

* `mise trust` state is located in `~/.local/state/mise/trusted-configs`
* There are two mise 'environments' to keep in mind: the host environment, which uses a specific version of mise downloaded
  just for Railpack, and the mise binary run during the build process. The mise version will be the same, but the environment
  is different.
* If `mise tool erlang` reports a `core:` plugin it means this plugin is compiled into the mise binary and its source is available with the mise monorepo. This can be confusing since there are often open source shell-based repos available for a tool as well, but they are unused by default.

### Linux shell (Apple container machine)

On Apple Silicon Macs you can open a Linux environment that uses the
host Docker daemon and a Linux-native mise install via
`mise run mise-linux-shell`.

This creates (or reuses) an Alpine-based [container machine](https://github.com/apple/container)
that connects to the host docker. This is helpful for debugging linux-only issues with the test suite.

### Mise Commands

Some helpful commands for debugging issues with mise:

```bash
# Lint and format
mise run check

# Where is a particular binary?
mise where pipx:squawk-cli@

# Run tests
mise run test

# Start the docs dev server
mise run docs-dev

# Inspect what backend is being used for a given tool
mise tool poetry

# test a tool out without adding it to your environment
mise exec pipx:httpie -- http google.com
```

## Debugging

Here's some helpful debugging tricks:

* `URFAVE_CLI_TRACING=on` for debugging CLI argument parsing
* `RAILPACK_DEBUG=1` for debugging Railpack debug logging
* `--build-arg verbose=true` for debugging the frontend (or `--opt build-arg:verbose=true` with `buildctl`)
* `docker logs -f buildkit` to see the BuildKit daemon logs, which includes railpack logs when it's used as a frontend
* `docker logs -f railpack-registry` to inspect local registry logs. Helpful for debugging cache import/export issues.
* `mise run cli -- --verbose build --show-plan --progress plain examples/node-bun`
* `mise run build`, add `./bin/` to your `$PATH`, and then run `railpack` in a separate local directory
* `docker exec buildkit buildctl prune` to clean the builder cache
* `NO_COLOR=1`

### Inspecting LLB Output

The `--dump-llb` flag outputs the raw BuildKit LLB (Low-Level Builder)
definition, which can be piped to various tools for inspection:

#### Visualize LLB as a graph

```bash
mise run cli build $(pwd) --dump-llb | \
  buildctl debug dump-llb --dot | \
  dot -Tpng > graph.png
```

#### Inspect LLB as JSON

```bash
mise run cli build $(pwd) --dump-llb | \
  buildctl debug dump-llb | \
  fx
```

_Note: Any JSON visualization tool can be used (jq, fx, jless, etc.)_

#### Build directly with buildctl

```bash
mise run cli build $(pwd) --dump-llb | \
  buildctl build \
    --progress=plain \
    --trace=build.log \
    --local context=.
```

### Interactive Debugging with Delve

```sh
mise run debug-cli build $(pwd)
```

Then, set some breakpoints:

```
break core/providers/node/node.go:177
continue
```

The commands you probably want: `ls`, `print build.Commands`, `continue`, `next`, `locals`,

## Docker / BuildKit

### Frontend

* When using Railpack as a frontend, all logs go to the buildkit container logs, and are not outputted to the build progress logs.
* `buildctl` is the lower level interface to BuildKit compared to `docker buildx`. There are more options available for debugging.
* `builtctl` and `docker buildx` handle arguments differently. `--build-arg` prefixes the argument with `build-arg:`. `--opt` does not prefix the build arg at all. You must prefix args with `build-arg:` if they are arguments handled by the railpack frontend.

### Cache

* Cache export does not require any logic within railpack. This is given "for free" since we are using BuildKit LLB.
* However, all import cache support must be implemented in Railpack. BuildKit is careful not to be too opinionated about defaults.
* If you use a registry cache you can tail the logs to inspect what is actually being pulled/pushed when building an image.
* There's no util methods for parsing the cache kv comma-separated strings in the buildkit module.

## Node

The node provider is the most complex.

### Corepack

* `corepack` used to be included by default in node. It was removed in node 25. Now it must be installed via `npm install -g`
* corepack does not support node 25. >= 26 is officially required.
* corepack is installed into `node_modules` but the package managers that corepack installs are added to `COREPACK_HOME`
  which we customize to be a `/opt` path.
* `corepack prepare` generates shims next to the `node` binary. These symlink to `.js` files.
* We detect corepack usage based on the `package.json > engines > pnpm, etc` fields. If we find this, we `npm install -g` corepack for the user. However, this happens *after* the mise install step and the corepack commands end up mutating the global node_modules dirs.
* In order to make sure these changes are picked up by future steps (i.e. if `pnpm run` is used in a `startCommand`) we have to include the mise shims folder and the mise node folder from the build step.
  * All shims are installed into `/mise/shims`. There are no subfolders.

## Maintenance

There are some manual maintenance tasks that need to be done periodically:

* Mise versions need to updated
* Test snapshots which use `latest` for runtime versions need to be updated periodically.
* Elixir<>OTP version map needs to be updated as new major versions come out.
* PNPM lockfile versions are manually mapped to minimum pnpm versions
* Pnpm default version needs to be updated as LTS versions are released.
* Node default version needs to be updated as LTS versions are released.
