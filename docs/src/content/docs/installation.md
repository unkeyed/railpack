Linux and MacOS are supported.

Windows builds are generated but not officially supported. That being said, PRs
are welcome to fix any Windows-specific bugs.

## Agent Skill

The repository includes an [Agent Skill](https://agentskills.io) that teaches
compatible coding agents how to configure `RAILPACK_*` variables, construct
`railpack.json`, and run builds locally.

```
