description: Understanding Railpack's caching mechanisms

Railpack uses both BuildKit layer and mount caches to speed up successive
builds.

## Layer Cache

Railpack uses BuildKit's layer cache and avoids busting the cache
when possible. Cache busting events are defined in a granular way as part of the
[steps commands list](/architecture/overview/#build-step). These include:

- Copying files from the local context to the build context
- Changing environment variables
- Adding new generated files to the build context
- Executing shell commands in the build context

### Cache Backends

Railpack supports all [BuildKit cache
backends](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/backends/).

- `railpack build` supports the same CLI arguments as `docker buildx` for cache
  import/export. See the [CLI reference](/reference/cli/#build) for more
  information.
- Cache import/export references are supported when using the frontend directly
  with `docker buildx` or `buildctl`. See the [frontend
  reference](/platforms/buildkit-frontend/#configuration) for more information.

## Mount Cache

The [BuildKit mount
cache](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/optimize/#use-cache-mounts)
is used to save the contents of a directory from the build context between
builds. This is useful for speeding up commands that download or compile assets
(e.g. npm install). The directory **does not** appear in the final image.

Caches are defined in the build plan and referenced by steps that need them.
Each cache has a type and a directory:

### Cache Types

- `shared`: Multiple builds can use this cache simultaneously (used for package
  manager caches)
- `locked`: Only one build can use this cache at a time (used for apt caches to
  prevent concurrent package installations)

Caches are shared across all steps that reference them. This is useful for
common caches such as the apt-cache or apt-lists.
